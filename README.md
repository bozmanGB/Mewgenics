<p>Assemble the ultimate feline army through tactical selection and send them into daring turn-based battles. Explore a variety of abilities, items, and catgene manipulation in this game from the creators of The Binding of Isaac and The End is Nigh.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Turn-Based, Cat-Based Tactical Rogue-Lite</p>
<p>The latest creation from Edmund McMillen (The Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) and Tyler Glael (Closure, The End Is Nigh) is a deep, tactical legacy rogue-lite that asks the following questions:</p>

<p>What if you bred an entire army of mustachioed warriors and sent them on tactical adventures in search of food, money, and other untold riches?</p>
<h4>Cat Cycle:</h4>
<p>Welcome to the Outback, where, in your own home, you'll assemble a team of cats from an ever-growing litter every single day and equip them with class-specific collars (fighter, tank, mage, and more). Then send this purring horde of mutants tearing through battles filled with turn-based tactics, powerful combos, and reactive environments.</p>


<h4>Battles for the Brainy:</h4>
<p>Each run is a mystery to solve with over 1,000 unique abilities (75 per class), 900 items, and numerous environmental interactions. This depth is unprecedented, offering a wealth of possibilities for both experimentation and optimization.</p>
<h4>Selective breeding is the future:</h4>
<p>Your furry friends return home with battle scars and experience. (And sometimes a couple of new heads!) Develop strange skills and mutations, tinker with pedigrees, play the gene lottery, and breed even more unusual and powerful felines for your new adventures.</p>

<h4>Epic scale:</h4>
<ul><li>Approximately 200 hours of main campaign</li></ul>
<ul><li>Over 10 character classes with 75 unique abilities each</li></ul>
<ul><li>Over 900 completely wild items</li></ul>
<ul><li>Over 200 enemy and boss types</li></ul>
<ul><li>Rogue-lite progression: every time like the first time</li></ul>
<ul><li>Choices at every turn! Money! Items! And genes! Everything matters.</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;"><strong>From simplicity to endless difficulty:</strong></span></p>
<p>Mewgenics draws you in gradually. During your first few runs, you'll only be learning the basics, but very soon you'll begin optimizing breeding processes, discovering unexpected combinations of abilities, and wondering whether to keep a cute kitten for yourself or give it to one of the many NPCs in exchange for upgrading your home. Mewgenics gives you the opportunity to hone your tactics in this world of chaotic, emergent gameplay.</p>
<p>Create, experiment, adapt! There will always be a new way or two to break this game.</p>
